        <h2 id="experience">My experience in Woodward Technology Center</h2>
        <div class="box2"></div>
        <div class="box3"></div>
        
        <div class="pl"><p><span class="firstl">I</span> am in the cisco networking porgram at Rock Valley so most of my clsses are at the Woodward Technology Center on main campus. I came to Rock Valley as a high school graduate who was not quite sure what they wanted to do yet and I took some basic intro classes. At Rock Valley everyone takes an intro to computers class which sparked my intrest in making a career out of computers. That class set me up to spend a lot of hours in this building. The images above are of the lobby and one of the many study areas on campus this area has been home to long hours by me. </p></div>
        <div class="box4"></div>
        <p><span class="firstl">W</span>oodward is a great place on campus where I have met some cool proffessors and some even greater students. I have spent time after class talking many nights learning more on a differnt way to code or getting a second opinion on a life decision. The Woodward Technology Center has shown me more in 1 building than other whole school, I have visited, proffesors that actually care about what happens to you after college in a career.</p>
        
        <p><span class="firstl">R</span>ock Valley College is a great school where everyone who comes here grows in some way. Some will grow closer to others some will meet their life partner and others will move on to make another school a better place from what they learned at Rock Valley College. </p>

        <h2 id="recommend">My recommendation about Rock Valley</h2>
        
        <p><span class="firstl">W</span>hen you go to make your schedule be sure to talk to a counsellor. Reason for seeing them is they can guide you in what to take and when to take it. I recommend taking STU&mdash;100 as soon as you can fit it in your schedule. Reason being that it will help you find what resources are available to you through out your time at Rock Valley College. </p>
        
        <p><span class="firstl">O</span>ne of the first things that I had to learn to pick classes at Rock Valley College was what class is under what abbreviations. Being that Rock Valley offer over 100 programs to keep track of abbreviations help to keep track of all of them so the table below is to help you keep track of them.</p>
